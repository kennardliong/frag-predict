Still uses the model trained with just 50 drugs - need to update model later.
app.py needs to be continually run


now has:
- Fragment combination functionality
- upload two smiles
- Protein-dependent scoring function


TO add later:
- CSV of SMILES input functionality, and being able to pick which two fragments to combine to test (by docking)
- Dropdowns to display multiple fragments/inputs and keep UI looking clean
